      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "How does speaker identification (diarization) work?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Speaker identification (also called speaker diarization) uses advanced AI to analyze unique voice characteristics including pitch, tone, speaking pace, and vocal patterns. The AI creates a 'voice fingerprint' for each speaker in your recording and uses this to identify when each person is speaking. It then labels the transcript accordingly (Speaker 1, Speaker 2, etc.) and can separate the audio into individual tracks. The technology is similar to what's used by transcription services like Otter.ai and Rev.com."

    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Can Speaker Split handle recordings with background noise?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Speaker Split's WhisperX AI is trained to handle various audio conditions including moderate background noise. However, for best results, we recommend: recording in quiet environments when possible, using quality microphones, avoiding recordings with loud music or TV in background, minimizing echo and reverb. Even with some background noise, the AI typically achieves 80-90% accuracy. Heavily distorted or very noisy audio may have reduced accuracy."

      "name": "What is the maximum file size I can upload?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Speaker Split accepts audio files up to 500MB in size. This is sufficient for most use cases: a 500MB MP3 file can contain over 8 hours of audio at standard quality. If you have larger files, you can either compress them using audio software, split them into smaller segments, or contact us about enterprise solutions for handling very long recordings. Most podcast episodes, meeting recordings, and interviews fall well under this limit."

    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Can I edit the transcript after processing?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes, after Speaker Split generates your transcript, you can review and edit it directly in the interface. Common edits include: correcting any misheard words, adjusting speaker labels if needed, removing filler words (um, uh), and adding punctuation. Once you're satisfied with the transcript, you can download it or use it to generate documents. The original audio and transcript remain available in your account for future reference."

      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "How is Speaker Split different from other transcription tools?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Speaker Split stands out from competitors in several ways: 1) It's completely free for basic use while competitors charge per minute, 2) Speaker audio separation - download individual speaker tracks (unique feature), 3) AI document generation built-in, 4) No software to install, 5) Privacy-focused with automatic file deletion, 6) High accuracy using state-of-the-art WhisperX AI.

      "name": "Can I use Speaker Split for legal or medical transcription?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Speaker Split can be used for legal depositions, medical dictation, and other professional transcription needs. However, please note: 1) AI transcription should be reviewed by a human for critical documents, 2) For HIPAA-compliant medical transcription, additional security measures may be required, 3) Legal transcripts may require certified human review, 4) Speaker Split provides excellent first drafts that significantly reduce manual transcription time. Many legal and medical professionals use AI transcription as a starting point, then review and certify the final document."

    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What happens if the speakers talk over each other?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "When speakers talk over each other (called 'crosstalk'), Speaker Split handles it as follows: The AI attempts to separate and transcribe both speakers, but accuracy may be reduced for overlapping segments. The transcript will indicate where overlap occurred when possible. For speaker separation, overlapping audio may be included in both speakers' tracks. To get the best results, try to minimize crosstalk in recordings when possible. Brief overlaps are handled well, but extended simultaneous speaking is challenging for any transcription system."

    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Does Speaker Split add timestamps to transcripts?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes, Speaker Split automatically adds timestamps to your transcripts. Each speaker segment includes a timestamp showing when that portion of speech began. Timestamps are displayed in minutes and seconds (e.g., [2:34]) and are included in exported documents. This makes it easy to find specific parts of the conversation, create clips or quotes with timing references, and navigate long recordings. Timestamps are particularly useful for podcast show notes and meeting minutes."
